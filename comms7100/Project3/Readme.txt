compile instructions

To compile everything put all three files in the same folder and run the line
gfortran -o Project3 linAlg.f90 Project3.f90
in a compiler. I'm using the minGW compiler from
http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds
but it should work with any fortran compiler, windows or linux.

Just run is using 
Project3
It knows what file will have the data in it

The run that was used to fill out the worksheet is Results.txt
I then reduced N to 10000 for the data that was used to graph.
That data and graphs are combined.csv
