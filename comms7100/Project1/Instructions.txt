You should be able to compile this on linux with the g++ compiler and the line:

g++ -o Project1 Project1.cpp helper.cpp

You should then be able to run the program with the file you want to process as a command line argument.
If you don't use the command line argument the program will prompt you for a file name.

If that doesn't work you can download a windows compiler at:
https://nuwen.net/mingw.html

I used the self extracting archive. You can then double click open_disto_window.
This opens a command line at the MinGW folder and you'll have to navigate to the folder where all of the files are by using cd.
From here you should be able to compile with the line:
g++ -o Project1 Project1.cpp helper.cpp -I.

You can then run it from that window as you would've on Linux.
