compile instructions

To compile everything put all three files in the same folder and run the line
gfortran -o Project2 helpP2.f90 linAlg.f90 Project2.f90
in a compiler. I'm using the minGW compiler from
http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds
but it should work with any fortran compiler, windows or linux.
